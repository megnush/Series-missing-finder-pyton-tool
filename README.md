# Series-missing-finder-pyton-tool
This is a Python program that uses tkinter library to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool to find missing series of numbers from a given text file. The tool sorts the numbers in the input file and finds the missing series, and then outputs the results to several output files.
